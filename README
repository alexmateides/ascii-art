This is my semestral project, that I did for my Programming and Algorithmics 2 (PA2) course at FIT CTU.

The objective was to develop an application that converts images into ASCII-art form. The application also had to support some basic functions like switching images, presentation mode and most importantly image filters.

The app was developed with the help of SDL2 for graphics and Nlohmann's JSON library for config parsing.

Currently supported functionalities and documentation (currently only in Czech) can be found in ./examples/text
